      <description>This is my honest opinion about Unit Testing in Software Engineering
Imagine now you are in the kitchen. You are going to make an omelet. Then, you must prepare the tools first, a stove, a pan, fried spoon, a knife etc. Then, you also must have the needs, such as eggs, pepper, salt etc.
Then, let’s make a new one. When making this new one, you must follow these steps without missing for a single thing.</description>

      <description>How does it feel when your code being reviewed and rejected
My first time to know about Code Review is when entering my current company at Kurio. In my past company before here, we never doing any code review. So everything is just passed to staging-branch and if tested well merge directly to master.
Here in my current company, we trained to do code reviewing for every team member. So everyone can review when there is an open pull request (PR) .</description>

      <description>Make your history more clean and readable
We just develop our new feature in Kurio. It is a targeted push notification. More about this you could read it here
We have a “good” enough development life here. When it was decided to create a new feature, a mini team will be assigned to their role. The team can consist of a few people from the different division, 2 from backend division, 1 from machine-learning division and so on based on the project needs.</description>

      <description>Based on my experiences with my personal opinion and thought
When we were still in college, we always demanded for studying hard. Having a good score in every class and also active in social community, club or something.
I remember when I was still in college, I always trying not to fail in my class. Also, I’m joining a club, a community by students. A geek one, it’s called “Programming Club”.</description>

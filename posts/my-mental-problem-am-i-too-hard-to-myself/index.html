                    <div class="article-post">
                        <p>Every morning, I always think about what makes me excited to finish this month? Waking up on the bed, and looking up the phone with a blank mind. Everything is less interesting from now on. It&rsquo;s like life has nothing new to offer now. There&rsquo;s nothing I want to do. I hate to say it, but I&rsquo;m like a living zombie.</p>
<p>I remembered, back then, when everything is good, I&rsquo;m brighter, I&rsquo;m the stars. At least that&rsquo;s how I feel from the look of people near me. My relatives said I was that good. But, little did they know, now, I&rsquo;m depressed. Sometimes I was thinking, am I too hard for myself? Pushing myself to its limit, and now I&rsquo;m hitting the limit, I&rsquo;m confused. I don&rsquo;t know what to do.</p>
<p>2020, was the damn hardest year for me. That was the year that all of this stress begins. I broke up with my girlfriend (again) after so many. We&rsquo;re dating since 2015, and there are a lot of things that happened, till both of us tired of making it up again in 2020 last year. I know that I&rsquo;m not a good man, I barely give any attention to our relationship. Not to mention, on our final day, she was got an accident, she fell from a bike when she back to her hometown. And she really needs me at that time, but it happened when I&rsquo;m having depression (till now when I write this article, but I&rsquo;m recovering a bit). I can&rsquo;t do much for her. Both of us demanding attention from each other, but we&rsquo;re both struggled, I&rsquo;m with my mental problem and she with her broken shoulder blade from the accident.</p>
<p>And, yeah, we couldn&rsquo;t make it. I&rsquo;m too tired to become a good man. Even for myself, I was helpless, how can I care for other people?</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s a few months already, I&rsquo;m still here, stuck on my mind. Keep asking myself, &ldquo;what was wrong with me?&rdquo;. On social media, and to people around me, I always tried to become a happy man, like not issue with myself. I build my own Gaming PC, with the high-end, spent so much money on that, hoping I can re-charge my mood to its original. I played the game like a hell, taking a leave for 2 weeks, then from day-1 to day-14, I played all the games I can found. But nothing&rsquo;s good. It&rsquo;s only making me more stressed by the end of my leave. And now my PC was there not used. I also dyed my hair color, hoping it will help me to make me more happy, but it&rsquo;s just the same. I&rsquo;m happy at that moment I got my first new hair color. But after that, I&rsquo;m still sad on being myself.</p>
<p>Another thing that I think also one of the reasons why I got depressed is, all of my side projects was failed. From Mabar, then Carislot, and then to some Game portal, and some idea to No-code platform, Easyread. I&rsquo;m overwhelmed with failure. I suck failures like the blood of a vampire. And dying crazy because of it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a time, this thought comes to my mind, what if I take a break and self-healing. Traveling to anywhere I could go. Hometown, random places, or to anywhere. But, it&rsquo;s hard when you&rsquo;re the first son, and your family was expecting you a lot. Even my family didn&rsquo;t expect anything from me, but as a first-born son, I do have some responsibilities to help my family especially in this pandemic situation. I&rsquo;m lucky, I&rsquo;m still got paid in my job. And I can help my family survive this pandemic.</p>
<p>There are a lot of places that definitely I want to visit, I do want to visit, like, Bali, Lombok, Raja Ampat. Or maybe to the outside of Indonesia, like Cebu in Philipines, Thailand, Japan, Europe, UK, etc. But, I don&rsquo;t know, I just wished, I wish I can get rid of this sense of responsibility for at least like a year, or until I recovered. I wish I can have a fun time to myself. Looking at my life purposes again. Is it wrong to run from responsibilities like this?</p>

<p>Thinking this again, also makes me think the worse idea. What if I die, what if I suicide. And I don&rsquo;t have to stress about life. It&rsquo;s done. Why do I have to live like this?
But then, this sense of responsibility comes again to strike me, like &ldquo;what happens if you die, what will you do to your family, how come you think this like an easy option? Don&rsquo;t you strong enough to face this? Won&rsquo;t be your family really sad?&rdquo; And it&rsquo;s true, I can survive from the worst of my life (in terms of poverty), and now I&rsquo;m here being able to get a job. But am I not strong enough to fix this?</p>
<p>Oh damn&hellip;</p>
<p>I think I need something, but I don&rsquo;t what it is. What really I&rsquo;m looking for?
I don&rsquo;t know what to do, I&rsquo;m stressed. Even talking to a psychologist not really help me a lot. The only take away that I got from my psychologist is</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Everybody has diffrent problem at a different level.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This quote hit me so much. We all have problems with our own capability. But, I think, this is just too much for me. I&rsquo;m not happy with my life.</p>
<p>But if I remember correctly, there&rsquo;s a time that I feel happy though, and it&rsquo;s on the night of the new year of 2021. I drink like a mad man, beers, vodka, and wine. That night, I think I&rsquo;m happy and&hellip; drunk. Alone in my room like doing crazy shit. Singing, and watching movies. Flirting with random people through WhatsApp. And it happens on that long night. But, it&rsquo;s temporary.</p>
<p>Because the next day, I&rsquo;m back to feeling lost. I felt lost myself, the old me. The awesome of me. Iman that for all people known to be a role model for some people (at least they said I&rsquo;m their role model directly, not something to happy though, it&rsquo;s just another extra pressure).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Oh life&hellip; why hitting me so hard&hellip;.. why it&rsquo;s hard to find a certain purpose? Why I can&rsquo;t be my old me, being ambitious, and dream big?</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>But, this past few days, I feel re-charged a bit. I&rsquo;m still not sure, but some people said, love, can cure everything, cielah. I just found this girl though. I know her for a long time already, but I just spoke with her recently. I think it&rsquo;s not about love, but more like a fellow of depressed people. She&rsquo;s been there, stressed on her life purposes as well. And now she can stand on her own feet, fix her problem. I admire her as he can survive, then, I might be able to learn a few things from her, how to survive from this quarter-life crisis.</p>
<p>I ask her to bring me to a fun place, and yeah, I&rsquo;m seeing new things that I never really cared about. Like, going to a pet cafe, playing with dogs, and cute piggy. And playing some never-heard boardgame. 5 years of my career, I always focus on work and work. Never really care about social life.  I do playing futsal, but the pandemic hit us too much. It&rsquo;s so hard to find fellow futsal boys now.</p>
<p>She said I lack social activities, and that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m trying to be more sociable now, finding new hobbies that can be done in this current situtation, that can be done alone or with her *ehm. I want to do anything that I have never done before. But, I&rsquo;m afraid, on my fragile moment right now, small affection and attention can be really dangerous, I&rsquo;m too afraid to fall in love now. As I know, I failed once already. I really hate it when dealing with emotions. But it&rsquo;s cute, how come and a not fun, nerd, geek engineer can feel this way tho? LOL 😂</p>
<p>So this is a prove, that we&rsquo;re all human, now I&rsquo;m more believe I&rsquo;m a human too.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m still trying to finding my life purposes, and more sociable like &ldquo;my crush&rdquo; said LOL. I wish I can survive, and back to my original. Please wish me luck my future me, so we can meet in happiness!</p>

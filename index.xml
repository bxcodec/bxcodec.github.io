      <description>Based on my experiences with my personal opinion and thought
When we were still in college, we always demanded for studying hard. Having a good score in every class and also active in social community, club or something.
I remember when I was still in college, I always trying not to fail in my class. Also, I’m joining a club, a community by students. A geek one, it’s called “Programming Club”.</description>

      <description>My honest opinion how to survive being a Junior Programmer
Being junior is a bit scary. It’s like too many things that we must know and learn. The system, the teams, the new technology, and everything. Currently, I can said, I’m a junior in my office. But time by the time, my task increased and more deep. At the beginning I just instructed to code something, then report to my team lead.</description>

      <description>And what I can learned and improve by being a shit.
Become software developer is not a title, but it’s a responsibilities we must faced. When it’s not good, then say no, otherwise say yes. Don’t be the sh*t programmer.

      <description>This path is too risky, but there are no other shortcut.
Writing is one of my hobby since I was still in high school. But write an English story is merely new for me. I started writing an English article/story since a year ago.
TLDR:
 This is my personal story Don’t expect a great story, because I’m on my way to improve myself.  My Way in Writing I still remember, a few years ago.</description>
